## Introduction
With so many players in the market in today's era of e-business, having more than one sales channel and keeping the stock updated on all of them is every entrepreneur's nightmare. Whether it is a physical store, an online store, or more than one marketplace, stock, order, and product syncing is a must to avoid mistakes, over-selling, and customer unhappiness.

It helps your Unleashed Retail POS and Shopify online store exchange information easily with each other, keeping your stock in check and your business thriving. You can integrate your platforms, automate workflows, and focus on growing your business through a couple of simple steps.

## What is Unleashed Shopify Integration?
Unleashed Shopify integration is a software that connects your Unleashed Retail POS to your online Shopify store.
